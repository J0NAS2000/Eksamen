      CheerZ is a bar at Zealand Køge which is founded by me 
      and some fellow students. I am the president of CheerZ 
      and have been a crucial part of building the brand, creating 
      events, and making Zealand Køge a better place to be.

    <h1> My role in CheerZ </h1>
    <p> My role in CheerZ was undefined in the beginning, but as I was 
        already the chairman of our DSR (Student Council) it was evident 
        that I would also take on this responsibility in CheerZ.
        As a leader I had to stand in front and take the decisions for our brand,
        which has resulted CheerZ to grow a lot over a span of 2-3 months time.

    <h1> Definition of project </h1>
    <p> In the start there was no party commitee at our school, so we had 
        to build everything up from scratch. The objective was to create an 
        experience for all students at our school and a great one.
